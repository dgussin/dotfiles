# dotfiles

I'm learning a ton about [dotfiles, command line use, Homebrew, zsh, git, and more](http://dotfiles.eieio.xyz) with the course [***Dotfiles from Start to Finish-ish***](http://dotfiles.eieio.xyz) by [
@EIEIOxyz
](https://twitter.com/EIEIOxyz/), and you can too!

## Update Brewfile after installing formulas, casks, taps
execute the following after `brew install`
```zsh
brew bundle dump --force --describe 
```

## TODO
- Terminal Preferences
- Changed Shell to ZSH
- Dock Preferences
- Mission Control Preferences (don't rearrange spaces)
- Finder Show Path Bar
- Trackpad (Three Finger Drag and Tap to Click)
- Git (config and SSH)
- Alfred (turn off Spotlight shortcut and use for Alfred)
- Snappy (turn off cmd+shift+4 for screenshot and use for snappy)
- Share this repo with a MILLION people
